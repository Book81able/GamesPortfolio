These are all as fun to draw as the last, and making was an interesting art history research project.</p>\n<p>The other major part of this project was typographical. Because of how important the runes are in the game I thought it was logical to use the runes as the basis for the logo's typeface. I was planning on just getting a \"runic\" font of the internet but I couldn't really find anything appropraite so I made my own \"rune\" font. I had no experience with font work before partaking on that specfic project, but it was much more enjoyable then I expected and the outcome was the most destinctive logo for any game I've worked on. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Snielheim","tags":["Photoshop","Illustator"],"description":"The Allfather has a cold!","techs":["Designer","Card Artist"],"v_link":null,"repo_link":null,"demo_link":null,"ios_link":null,"android_link":null,"date":"19.
