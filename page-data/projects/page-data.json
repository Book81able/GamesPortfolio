Unlike most other game jams, Jam-O-Lantern had an abudence of composers and sound designers. The game had 3 composers and me. The composers did a really good job working on each of their peices, while I made the game for the songs to go in. </p>\n<h1>My Role</h1>\n<p>I was the lead dveloper on this project. Taking care of all parts of the games development beyond the sound and a the candy models. Most of my time spend on the project was spent level designing (8 levels in total.) Of course, programming was also a large degree of work, but I kept the code scope down to make sure the desgin had the focus. The other major part of the work was in animation. There's two custom cutscenes in the game which I managed the animation on along with the models used in the animations.</p>\n<h1>Process</h1>\n<p>The game took a week to make.</p>\n<p>The first few days we're spent perfecting the pumpkins movement stystem (more about that below.) </p>\n<p>The rest of the time was spent making the levels. Each level started from a hastily drawn sketch in my notebook and was implemented into the game with a set of basic building block elements that I built in Blender. I didn't have time to really conceptualize the meaning or progression of the levels, but I tried my best to increase the complexity of each level as you went along. The hardest level is level seven, which was made in the later stages of development once I really understood how this gourd got around. </p>\n<p>In the middle of level design I also felt the need to animate a cutscene for shooting the pumpkin off in a cannon (a nod to the sport of pumpkin chuckn) and a ending screen wishing the player a Happy Halloween. I don't claim to be an animator, but I was still proud of the work I did for these two scenes, along with the sqush and strect of the pumpkin when it hops into the air.</p>\n<h1>What I Learned</h1>\n<p>There were two major things that I learned in making this project.</p>\n<h3>3rd Person Controls</h3>\n<p>This might not be the largest thing, but this is the first 3D thrid person game I've made. As the programmer on the team I had to put together all the features needed for a 3D platformmer. That took 2-3 days to do, along with a particually busy week of school work. The jump and camera were the two biggest puzzles. Although for the camera I just went through a tutorial to get it configured the jump took much more effort to get right. To combine both repsponsive control and compeling animation I had to rethink how I build character object in Unity. The whole thing taught me how to get a project going.</p>\n<h3>Wwise</h3>\n<p>As you can see from this portfolio, although I have touched many parts of game development I've tried to keep a ten-foot pole between me and anything realtated to audio, partiucally composition. I know my strenghts and music and sound has never been one. However, for this project I had to shorten my distance to the audio team. We had three composers and a sound designer, all of whom wanted this game to be something they can show off. </p>\n<p>For that goal, it was decided to Wwise to manage the audio. I agreed but was daunted. I've spent years working on my skills in game dev programs. I opened my first game engine in 8th grade and I still feel like I've not learned even the start of stuff what you can. I like to give myself room to expriement and play around in new tools, that's how I reach mastery. That was not an option in the week we had, I had to learn Wwise and I had to learn it fast. Unlike moving to different game engines or image editing where I have a basic knowledge of terms and ideas I was dropped into the very unknown world of audio engeneering. On the first day of downloading the software I was sure I would fail. It was simply too much in too little time.</p>\n<p>However, I kept reading documentation and looking at tutorials. By day three we had the sounds dyanmically playing in the game. On day five I remade our sound effect system after a source control error. It was honestly scary, but I learned Wwise to the level needed in the game in about 5 days.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gourd/"}},{"frontmatter":{"date":"1 September, 2020","title":"Raccoon Revenge","repo_link":null,"demo_link":null,"techs":["Programming","Level Design","Production"],"tags":["Unity"],"description":"Snatcher the Raccoon Bandit wants to overthrow the human race!

Focuses within the team include an artist, UI designer, two programmers, and a producer.</p>\n<h1>My Role</h1>\n<p>With such a talented team, I knew from the start that I would have to find the gaps that I could fill. A pivotal moment in establishing myself in the team was when I voulenteered to go to a talk on the companies build process. This lead to me being the build manager for the game, which is a role I took twice a week on our designated build days. It was not the role I wanted going into the project, but I actually had a lot of fun writing the game's copy and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTeuB3LMU_KaYi3dyCe6PUbUKHIR36p4kQ1rl13FWmCysYAfs5h4iouDqJMIEXfbjJ8L12flUmYpV2V/pub\">build notes</a>, although it was still painful when builds wouldn't work. </p>\n<p>On the non-build days I mainly acted as a programmer for the team, I implmented systems such a level based <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT5ulz11r74DPeIVt8S35GUwIAlrN5BUame7l-E_i7UZSYvBSsVp51xx2uXnG8Kk35ZrgbXsbXbi3Hd/pub\">randomly-generated powerup system</a> and a 32x32 texture to playable level generator. I worked with the other programmers to maintain a profesional code base and project structure. </p>\n<p>I was also the associate producer of the game, which meant mostly that I managed our digital Kanban board and source control. </p>\n<p>Lastly, I was a major influence on the games design, mostly through level design and data analysis. From the moment we had a system to design levels I started prototyping levels to find what worked best for the game. In total I prototyped around 100 levels, with only one level of mine actual being in the game at launch. It's not that only 1/100 of my levels are good, but that I was building those as tests during development and letting the rest of the team use the insights to make the levels. This came with both heavily <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQdFMi_ztiv1FQv6Lhn3Xwu6gQ5AS2-1QnqEXbC5gDkUeduMRKgnmm6igjjfiRrPVZasRZHvPU41yVp/pub\">documenting the design process</a> and analyzing beta test resualts using our data platform. We used the data gathered from the beta phase to create the final set of levels, and I lead the process of using the data to make informed design descions. </p>\n<p>Those are the major areas I contributed to, however I wore many more (and drew a few) hats in this project because of the scope of the game and the small size of team.

This was a complete lifesaver to organize our ideas while remotely working. Here's just a snippet of what the team's board looked like.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Production lasted for 10 weeks once we settled on the idea of Snatcher the Raccoon bandit. We started with prototypes of the movement, attacking, trash collecting, and AI. After the basic systems were in place we shifted to maximizing polish of the games elements with art, sound, and UI. We also added new content in the form of hats and levels for the last two months of development.</p>\n<h1>What I Learned</h1>\n<p>In short, a whole lot.

It's not my best work, but due to the explosive popularity of the meme, it continues to be my most popular game.</p>\n<p>The entire game was made in about 8 hours, with maybe half of that being bug fixing because I was still rather new to Unity at that time, and had never made a fully 2D game in the engine before.</p>\n<h2>Process</h2>\n<p>The process went like so:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pixel Art</li>\n<li>Father</li>\n<li>Pigs</li>\n<li>Levels</li>\n<li>Release</li>\n<li>Sounds and Polish</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First thing I did was get the art for the feral hogs and the father drawn up and in the game. Once there I got the basic movement and shooting in. Then I got the pigs to spawn semi-randomly to run towards the poor children. Once there was the full gameplay loop (and oh so small of a loop it is) I implemented the game controller and round system along with the UI. The moment the game was fully playable I exported a build and put it up on <a href=\"https://elijahcobb.itch.io/30-50-feral-hogs\">Itch.io</a>. This was becasue time was of the essense on this project. The meme grew older every hour and would soon vanish into the depths of internet lore. If I didn't get the game out night of, I would lose a drastic amount of potential players. (2/3 of total views happened in the first 3 days after of launch.) </p>\n<p>It was only after getting a good nights rest that I returned to the project to add the ever imporant gun shot sound effect and smoke particles.</p>\n<p>After releasing the update I spent the rest of the day taking in the media wave that I had just hitched a ride on. Beyond the explosion of twitter these media outlets mentioned the game in their coverage of the meme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vox</li>\n<li>Washinton Post</li>\n<li>Slate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And these sites covered the game in a full article</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forbes</li>\n<li>Indie Game Website</li>\n<li>Geek.com</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/30-50/"}},{"frontmatter":{"date":"19 July, 2019","title":"Snielheim","repo_link":null,"demo_link":null,"techs":["Designer","Card Artist","Vuetify"],"tags":["Photoshop","Illustator"],"description":"The Allfather has a cold!","cover_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/75241ad3d6370d9d44c51ae5f1d23934/ee604/snifelheim.png","srcSet":"/static/75241ad3d6370d9d44c51ae5f1d23934/69585/snifelheim.png 200w,\n/static/75241ad3d6370d9d44c51ae5f1d23934/497c6/snifelheim.png 400w,\n/static/75241ad3d6370d9d44c51ae5f1d23934/ee604/snifelheim.png 800w,\n/static/75241ad3d6370d9d44c51ae5f1d23934/31987/snifelheim.png 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"html":"<p>Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
