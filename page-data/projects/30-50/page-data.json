It's not my best work, but due to the explosive popularity of the meme, it continues to be my most popular game.</p>\n<p>The entire game was made in about 8 hours, with maybe half of that being bug fixing because I was still rather new to Unity at that time, and had never made a fully 2D game in the engine before.</p>\n<h2>Process</h2>\n<p>The process went like so:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pixel Art</li>\n<li>Father</li>\n<li>Pigs</li>\n<li>Levels</li>\n<li>Release</li>\n<li>Sounds and Polish</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First thing I did was get the art for the feral hogs and the father drawn up and in the game. Once there I got the basic movement and shooting in. Then I got the pigs to spawn semi-randomly to run towards the poor children. Once there was the full gameplay loop (and oh so small of a loop it is) I implemented the game controller and round system along with the UI. The moment the game was fully playable I exported a build and put it up on <a href=\"https://elijahcobb.itch.io/30-50-feral-hogs\">Itch.io</a>. This was becasue time was of the essense on this project. The meme grew older every hour and would soon vanish into the depths of internet lore. If I didn't get the game out night of, I would lose a drastic amount of potential players. (2/3 of total views happened in the first 3 days after of launch.) </p>\n<p>It was only after getting a good nights rest that I returned to the project to add the ever imporant gun shot sound effect and smoke particles.</p>\n<p>After releasing the update I spent the rest of the day taking in the media wave that I had just hitched a ride on. Beyond the explosion of twitter these media outlets mentioned the game in their coverage of the meme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vox</li>\n<li>Washinton Post</li>\n<li>Slate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And these sites covered the game in a full article</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forbes</li>\n<li>Indie Game Website</li>\n<li>Geek.com</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"30-50 Feral Hogs","tags":["Unity","Photoshop"],"description":"Legit Question for Rural Americans: How do I kill the 30-50 feral hogs that run into my yard within 3-5 mins while my small kids play?
