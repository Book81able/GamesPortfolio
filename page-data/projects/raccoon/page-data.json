Focuses within the team include an artist, UI designer, two programmers, and a producer.</p>\n<h1>My Role</h1>\n<p>With such a talented team, I knew from the start that I would have to find the gaps that I could fill. A pivotal moment in establishing myself in the team was when I voulenteered to go to a talk on the companies build process. This lead to me being the build manager for the game, which is a role I took twice a week on our designated build days. It was not the role I wanted going into the project, but I actually had a lot of fun writing the game's copy and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTeuB3LMU_KaYi3dyCe6PUbUKHIR36p4kQ1rl13FWmCysYAfs5h4iouDqJMIEXfbjJ8L12flUmYpV2V/pub\">build notes</a>, although it was still painful when builds wouldn't work. </p>\n<p>On the non-build days I mainly acted as a programmer for the team, I implmented systems such a level based <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT5ulz11r74DPeIVt8S35GUwIAlrN5BUame7l-E_i7UZSYvBSsVp51xx2uXnG8Kk35ZrgbXsbXbi3Hd/pub\">randomly-generated powerup system</a> and a 32x32 texture to playable level generator. I worked with the other programmers to maintain a profesional code base and project structure. </p>\n<p>I was also the associate producer of the game, which meant mostly that I managed our digital Kanban board and source control. </p>\n<p>Lastly, I was a major influence on the games design, mostly through level design and data analysis. From the moment we had a system to design levels I started prototyping levels to find what worked best for the game. In total I prototyped around 100 levels, with only one level of mine actual being in the game at launch. It's not that only 1/100 of my levels are good, but that I was building those as tests during development and letting the rest of the team use the insights to make the levels. This came with both heavily <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQdFMi_ztiv1FQv6Lhn3Xwu6gQ5AS2-1QnqEXbC5gDkUeduMRKgnmm6igjjfiRrPVZasRZHvPU41yVp/pub\">documenting the design process</a> and analyzing beta test resualts using our data platform. We used the data gathered from the beta phase to create the final set of levels, and I lead the process of using the data to make informed design descions. </p>\n<p>Those are the major areas I contributed to, however I wore many more (and drew a few) hats in this project because of the scope of the game and the small size of team. Some of those smaller roles include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trailer Editor</li>\n<li>Playtest Leader</li>\n<li>Icon artist</li>\n<li>Credits Writer</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Process</h1>\n<p>In total, the game's development took 4 months, from May to August 2020.</p>\n<h2>Conceptuilization</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/e32d8/RaccProcess.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Conceptulilization process\"\n        title=\"Conceptulilization process\"\n        src=\"/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/fcda8/RaccProcess.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/12f09/RaccProcess.png 148w,\n/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/e4a3f/RaccProcess.png 295w,\n/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/fcda8/RaccProcess.png 590w,\n/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/efc66/RaccProcess.png 885w,\n/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/c83ae/RaccProcess.png 1180w,\n/static/5bf76405abdadfeebf6e34a4cb88d1c7/e32d8/RaccProcess.png 8000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>For our brainstorming we made heavy use of Miro. This was a complete lifesaver to organize our ideas while remotely working. Here's just a snippet of what the team's board looked like.</p>\n<h2>Production</h2>\n<p>Production lasted for 10 weeks once we settled on the idea of Snatcher the Raccoon bandit. We started with prototypes of the movement, attacking, trash collecting, and AI. After the basic systems were in place we shifted to maximizing polish of the games elements with art, sound, and UI. We also added new content in the form of hats and levels for the last two months of development.</p>\n<h1>What I Learned</h1>\n<p>In short, a whole lot. If I listed out each lesson learned like my other project this page would take minutes to scroll down. To synthize the biggest lessons into the smallest form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organization is work and is very impornant work</li>\n<li>Test test test test</li>\n<li>The stronger the pitch the stronger the game will be</li>\n<li>SCOPE</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Raccoon Revenge","tags":["Unity"],"description":"Snatcher the Raccoon Bandit wants to overthrow the human race!
